Hey judges! Thanks so much for your time. Repocracy is a russian constructivist inspired website
for turning repos based in one SCM (git or hg) into the opposite SCM.

The cool thing? Add a web hook to your repo on github or bitbucket, and hell, we'll automatically
push changes from your (bitbucket|github) account to your (github|bitbucket) account.

This assumes you have a postgres database set up, and that you have a postgres user that
does not have password auth on (e.g., psql -Upostgres <anydb> works without having to provide a password).

It's building bridges! It's reuniting the repoletariat. Power to the people! All you need to do 
is::

    brew install rabbitmq
    virtualenv .
    pip install -E . -r pip_requirements.txt
    source bin/activate
    cat "127.0.0.1 repocracy.com" >> /etc/hosts # or add it in your favorite $EDITOR
    createuser postgres         # unnecessary if you already have a postgres user
    createdb -Upostgres repocracy
    repocracy/manage.py syncdb && repocracy/manage.py migrate

    # open up a shell and run...
    rabbitmq-server 

    # open up another shell and run...
    repocracy/manage.py celeryd --loglevel=DEBUG

    #open up yet another shell and run...
    repocracy/run-git-daemon.sh

    #seriously, the final shell to open... 
    sudo repocracy/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:80 # sorry, we have to sudo and use port 80 so twitter will work. 

And then you're cool as a cucumber.
