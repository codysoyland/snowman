Hey judges! Thanks so much for your time. Repocracy is a russian constructivist inspired website
for turning repos based in one SCM (git or hg) into the opposite SCM.

The cool thing? Add a web hook to your repo on github or bitbucket, and hell, we'll automatically
push changes from your (bitbucket|github) account to your (github|bitbucket) account.

It's building bridges! It's reuniting the repotetariat. Power to the people! All you need to do 
is::

    brew install rabbitmq
    virtualenv .
    pip install -E . -r pip_requirements.txt
    source bin/activate
    cat "127.0.0.1 repocracy.com" >> /etc/hosts # or add it in your favorite $EDITOR
    repocracy/manage.py syncdb && repocracy/manage.py migrate
    rabbitmq-server &
    repocracy/manage.py celeryd --loglevel=DEBUG &
    sudo repocracy/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:80 # sorry, we have to sudo and use port 80 so twitter will work. 

And then you're cool as a cucumber.
